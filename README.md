# Poker Engine

This is a graphical poker interface that is programmed to serve up to 6 players in a string of Texas Hold 'Em games. 

Currently not online multiplayer yet, as I'm still refining and debugging game logic but will start on client-server architecture and websocketing once the game backend is fully complete.

For now you can play as all 6 players and fiddle around with game mechanics, action sequences, etc.
